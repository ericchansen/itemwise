# Orchestration Log: Wash (Frontend)

**Session:** 2026-02-28T000700Z (Resilience)  
**Agent:** Wash (Frontend Dev)  
**Model:** claude-opus-4.6  
**Status:** SUCCESS

## Directive

Add frontend connection error feedback for API failures when Azure DB is unreachable.

## Outcome

✅ Implemented shared error feedback pattern across all frontend modules

### Changes
- Created `showConnectionError()` utility in `frontend/js/utils.js`
- Wired into 4 catch blocks in `frontend/js/items.js`
- Wired into 3 catch blocks in `frontend/js/settings.js`
- Added `#connection-error` dismissible banner to `frontend/index.html`
- Filters `Unauthorized` errors (handled by auth flow)

### Pattern
- Network errors (TypeError) → "⚠️ Can't connect to server. Please try again later."
- Other API errors → "⚠️ Something went wrong. Please try again later."
- Fixed-position banner auto-dismisses via existing `showAlert` pattern

## Decision Log

See `.squad/decisions/inbox/wash-error-feedback.md`

## Notes

Prevents silent error swallowing that left users seeing unresponsive buttons during DB outages. Banner visibility provides immediate feedback.
